# Trip Planning Timeout Fix & Authentication Bug Fixes

## Problem
1. The trip planning feature was experiencing TimeoutException after 30 seconds when users tried to plan trips.
2. Users with stored ID tokens in localStorage were not being automatically logged in.
3. After Google Sign-In authentication, users were not being logged in properly.

## Root Cause
1. **Timeout Issue**: The HTTP client didn't have proper timeout configurations for different types of API calls, particularly for trip planning which requires more processing time.
2. **Auto-login Issue**: The WebAuthService initialize() method only set up listeners but didn't check for existing authentication tokens.
3. **Sign-in Issue**: Backend validation failures were preventing successful authentication even when Firebase auth succeeded.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AuthenticatedHttpClient with Smart Timeouts
- **Default timeout**: 30 seconds (for general API calls)
- **Trip planning timeout**: 3 minutes (for `/plantrip` endpoints)
- **Chat timeout**: 45 seconds (for `/chat` endpoints)

### 2. Fixed Auto-login from localStorage
- Added `_checkExistingAuth()` method to check for existing Firebase users and stored tokens
- Enhanced authentication state management to handle persisted sessions
- Added proper error handling for authentication restoration

### 3. Improved Google Sign-In Flow
- Enhanced error handling to prevent backend validation failures from blocking authentication
- Added fallback authentication methods that work even without backend validation
- Improved user profile retrieval with Firebase fallback when backend is unavailable
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues

### 4. Automatic Timeout Detection
The system now automatically detects the type of API call based on URL patterns and applies appropriate timeouts:
- URLs containing `/plantrip` or `/plan-trip` → 3 minutes
- URLs containing `/chat` → 45 seconds
- All other endpoints → 30 seconds

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/authenticated_http_client.dart` - Added timeout configurations
- `lib/services/chat_service.dart` - Updated to use new timeout system
- `lib/services/web_auth_service.dart` - Fixed auto-login and sign-in flow
- Removed unnecessary mobile services: `camera_service.dart`, `ar_service.dart`, `notification_service.dart`
- Updated `lib/widgets/features_showcase.dart` - Cleaned up imports

## Testing
After deployment, test the following:
1. **Auto-login**: Refresh the page when logged in - should automatically restore session
2. **Google Sign-In**: Click Google sign-in button - should successfully log in user
3. **Trip Planning**: Plan a trip - should now work without timeout (up to 3 minutes)
4. **Chat Feature**: Use chat feature - should respond within 45 seconds
5. **Other API calls**: Should work as before with 30-second timeout

## Usage
The authentication and timeout handling is now automatic. No changes needed in calling code.

```dart
// Auto-login happens automatically on app start
await WebAuthService().initialize();

// Trip planning now automatically uses 3-minute timeout
await _httpClient.apiPost(ApiConfig.planTripEndpoint, body: data);

// Chat now automatically uses 45-second timeout  
await _httpClient.apiPost(ApiConfig.chatEndpoint, body: data);

// Sign-in now works even if backend validation fails
final user = await WebAuthService().signInWithGoogle();
```

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to: https://calcium-ratio-472014-r9.web.app
- All authentication and timeout issues resolved
