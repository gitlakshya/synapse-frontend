# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide for Synapse Frontend

## ✅ **Repository Status: Ready for CI/CD Pipeline**

Your repository is fully ready for automated deployment with:
- ✅ Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
- ✅ Successfully built and deployed application
- ✅ All timeout configurations optimized
- ✅ Mock data removed and API-driven functionality

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

### **Phase 1: GitHub Repository Configuration**

#### **Step 1: Push Workflow to GitHub**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\lakshya.vashisth\Documents\git repos\synapse-frontend"
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for Firebase deployment"
git push origin deployment
```

#### **Step 2: Merge to Main Branch**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge deployment branch
git merge deployment

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

---

### **Phase 2: Firebase Service Account Setup**

#### **Step 3: Create Firebase Service Account**

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/calcium-ratio-472014-r9/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk

2. **Generate New Private Key:**
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Download the JSON file (keep it secure!)

3. **Copy the JSON Content:**
   - Open the downloaded JSON file
   - Copy the entire JSON content

---

### **Phase 3: GitHub Secrets Configuration**

#### **Step 4: Add GitHub Repository Secrets**

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Select "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"

2. **Add Firebase Service Account Secret:**
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - **Name:** `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CALCIUM_RATIO_472014_R9`
   - **Value:** Paste the entire JSON content from Step 3
   - Click "Add secret"

---

### **Phase 4: Workflow Triggers Configuration**

#### **Step 5: Test the Pipeline**

The pipeline will automatically trigger on:
- ✅ **Direct pushes to main branch**
- ✅ **Merged pull requests to main branch**

**To test immediately:**
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# CI/CD Pipeline Active" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test CI/CD pipeline activation"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration Options**

### **Option 1: Branch Protection Rules**

1. **Go to Repository Settings → Branches**
2. **Add rule for main branch:**
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date

### **Option 2: Environment-Specific Deployments**

Create separate environments for staging and production:

```yaml
# Add to deploy.yml for staging environment
on:
  push:
    branches: [ development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development ]
    types: [ closed ]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    environment: staging
    # ... rest of the configuration
```

### **Option 3: Deployment Notifications**

Add Slack/Discord notifications:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    channel: '#deployments'
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: Service Account Authentication Failed**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify JSON format in GitHub secrets
# Ensure no extra spaces or characters
# Re-download service account key if needed
```

### **Issue 2: Build Fails on Dependencies**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Update pubspec.yaml version constraints
# Run flutter pub upgrade locally first
# Test build locally before pushing
```

### **Issue 3: Firebase Hosting Rules Conflict**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check firebase.json configuration
# Ensure hosting rules match build output
# Verify public directory is "build/web"
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Setup**

1. **Monitor First Deployment:**
   - Watch GitHub Actions tab for pipeline execution
   - Verify deployment at: https://calcium-ratio-472014-r9.web.app

2. **Set Up Branch Protection:**
   - Require PR reviews for main branch
   - Enable status checks requirement

3. **Configure Team Notifications:**
   - Add team members to repository
   - Set up deployment notifications

4. **Create Development Workflow:**
   - Use feature branches for new development
   - Create PRs to main for review and deployment

---

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

- ✅ **Never commit service account keys to repository**
- ✅ **Use GitHub secrets for all sensitive data**
- ✅ **Regularly rotate Firebase service account keys**
- ✅ **Enable branch protection rules**
- ✅ **Review all PR changes before merging**

---

## 📈 **Monitoring and Maintenance**

### **Regular Tasks:**
- Monitor deployment success rates
- Update Flutter version quarterly
- Review and update dependencies monthly
- Rotate service account keys annually

### **Performance Tracking:**
- Monitor build times in GitHub Actions
- Track deployment frequency
- Review failed deployment logs
